Concretile is a web application designed to partially automate the process of point counting on concrete thin-section samples, with a focus on samples taken in the Philippines.
To run the application locally, use the "run_local.sh" file in the root directory of the application. This will run the application as a local debug application that will not be visible to other computers. Alternatively, you can use the "run_remote.sh" file in the root directory of the application and run the application as a remote server. In both cases, you can access the application from the same computer by opening your browser and entering the url: "http://localhost:5000".
